You would stay at the Western Ridge.  It is a 4.0 star hotel with a 10/10 guest rating.  If, however, you would really like to travel to Mexico City, I have a great package for you at only 1168.35 USD.  You would stay at the Exalted Willow Resort & Suites.  It is a 3.5 star hotel with a 8.37/10 guest rating.  Which would you prefer?

Hi im from punta cana looking to go on a trip	Where would you like to travel to?
Im thinking to Fukuoka	Did you have any specific dates in mind?
maybe the 15th of August until the 20th	How many people will be travelling with you?
just myself	would the 15th to the 18th work for you?
where would i be staying?	HOTEL Sugoi in Fukuoka
what is the rating	It is a 3-star hotel and your package includes free wifi
and what if i were to go to Essen?	I have a couple of choices in Essen. Are you looking for a 2-star or a 3-star option?
The three star option	Your best choice would be the Relaxation Hotel which is a 3-star hotel and includes breakfast and wifi. It is available either from August 15th to August 27 or from August 27th to September 2nd.  Do either one of those dates fit into your schedule?
these dates don¡¯t look like they would be compatible with my schedule. Hey, how about going to hiroshima?	I apologize, I have nothing available to Hiroshima. Would you like me to explore other options?
Is there a flight to Santiago	I have several that suit your dates.. Your stay would be at the Una casa which is a 3-star hotel and includes free breakfast, wifi and parking, should you wish to rent a car and explore the surrounding areas.  The flight departs on August 15th and returns on the 20th.
can you compare the price of this and the one to the package in St. Loius	The package to Santiago is $2455.37 as opposed to the package to Essen which would be $3016.94. Please keep in mind that the trip to Essen is a longer trip though.
and how much is the trip to Fukuoka and what are the dates?	That package was $3794 based on economy class. It departed on August 15th with a return date of August 18th.
which of these have the best rated hotels?	In Fukuoka, the hotel is a 3-star, in Essen you have the option of a 2-star at $3016.94 or a 3-star at $3073.16 and in Santiago the hotel has a 3-star rating.
it seems to me that the packages in Essen are the best offer. So what are the dates?	Are you interested in the 2-star option or the 3-star option?
the 3 star hotel seems to be the best how much would it be to book a business class flight?	If you are looking for a business class flight, I only have one package that has the availability. It would be at the Motel Ivory which is the 2-star hotel and  is only available from August 26 to September 1st. The total price for that package is $3314.99.
If i were to choose economy class what would it be?	At the 2-star Motel Ivory Safari, for your original departure date of August 15 it is $3016.94. At the 3-star Relaxation Hotel,  it is $3073.16.  Is Essen your final choice for the destination?
yes i believe it will be. lets book the 3 star hotel	Fantastic. Let me get all your information so that we can finalize your reservation.
Hey! You can help me by finding a trip to Philadelphia from Maceio.	In Philadelphia you can stay at a 2.5 star hotel for 11 days. As for Fukuoka, 11 days at a 2.5 star hotel would cost 4719.74USD. I can offer 14 days in Essen for 3787.14USD; this would be at a 2.0 star hotel. 4 days at a 2.0 star hotel in San Antonio would cost 2311.48USD.
Let's start with Philadelphia, how much is it I upgrade to business class?	For this hotel in Philadelphia, it would cost 3340.56USD to travel from Maceio by business class.
And for a four star hotel?	Sorry, I only have 2.5 star hotels available in Philadelphia.
Let's see about Fukuoka upgraded to business class and a four star hotel.	I have a 3.5 star hotel available in Fukuoka, The Oceanside Hotel. It has a guest rating of 8.22/10. I could book you a business class trip for 11 days at 6228.88USD.
Is this hotel in the downtown area of the city?	I do not know the location of The Oceanside Hotel within the city of Fukuoka, sorry.
Is there a spa in the hotel?	There is no spa in the hotel, but there is free wifi.
I will keep this option in mind. How about Essen, do you have anything less than 14 days?	Do you have a length of stay in mind?
Around 11 days.	Sorry, I am only coming up with 14 day trips to Essen. Perhaps another nearby departure city would work?
Good idea. What about Canoas?	It seems that Canoas is not in my database.
What about porto alegre	I have multiple 5 day options available from Porto to Essen. 
I would prefer 11 days	Do you have a departure date in mind? Or an approximate departure date?
Anytime in the month of September	Unfortunately I only have 5 days options leaving from Porto available at this time.
In that case, let's go back to the Fukuoka 11 day package.	Would you like me to explore your Fukuoka options leaving from Porto Alegre?
Yes please.	I can offer 13 days in Fukuoka for 5777.48USD.
In that case, I will take the 11 day package. One more thing, is there free breakfast?	The 11 day trip to Fukuoka from Maceia is also during August. However, the Oceanside Hotel does provide free breakfast!
 I'll book this one. Thank you, friend!	Great, thank you!

how much will it cost?	The above price leaves August 17th and returns August 27th. To leave August 27th and return on September 6th, the price would be 2582.47USD.
What about leaving around September 13th?	You could leave September 16th and return September 26th for 2753.45USD.

That sounds very nice. Does the package include a business class flight?	2097.76USD is the cost for Economy flights. To upgrade to Business class would cost 2674.43USD. Would you like to book this trip with Business class flights?

Excellent. There is a possibility that I may need to bring a co-worker with me. How much would the trip cost for 2 people?	To include a second person on this trip, with both of you flying business class, the cost would be 5348.87USD
I see. In that case I will book this trip only for myself today.	Ok. Have a good day

I have 11 days of time off starting on August 17. Can you offer me any vacation packages leaving from Portland?	Hi, would you have a budget in mind for this trip?
No, I've recently inherited a gigantic sum of money.  I prefer 4 stars and above, as well as free breakfast if possible, please.	Would you have a special destination in mind? We will definitely look at luxury hotels that are only a 4 star or more rating.
No particular destination in mind, I'm just looking for an adventure. How about Paris to start?	I have the Muse available for 12 days but that is only a 2 star hotel.  However, I do have some suggestions. I have some excellent options available during that time period. A nice 4 star hotel in Calgary, Canada, another nice 4 star hotel in Marseille or a 4.5 star hotel in Frankfurt, Germany all with direct flights from Portland. Do any of these cities interest you?
The Marseille and Germany packages are very attractive. I'd like to know more about hotel in the Marseille package. Is breakfast included?	The Hotel Duchesse in Marseille is a 4 star hotel which provides you with free wifi, but breakfast is not included in the price. It is available from Sunday August 21st to Sunday August 28th. I forgot to ask, will you be travelling alone or with a companion?
I will be travelling alone. How much is this package?	This package on an economy flight is worth a total of $3049.54USD. Are you interested in booking it?
I am, but first I'd like to see what the price is with an upgrade to business class, and perhaps compare this package to the Germany deal.	There are no longer business class seats available for this particular package to Marseille. The Mellow Palms Resort in Frankfurt is a 10 day package available from Aug 19 to Aug 27 and includes free wifi and  free breakfast and has a 4.5 star rating. The total cost on this package, also based on an economy class flight is $3091.3USD.
Is it possible to upgrade the Frankfurt flight to business class?	This package is also only available with an economy class seat.
That's fine. I will book the 10 day Germany Mellow Palms Resort vacation package.	I will get that all booked up for you and send you an email confirmation.
Great, thank you. I will most certainly book my next vacation with you.	Enjoy your trip!

Hi there! I finally have some vacation time starting on August 22nd and I am hoping to go away somewhere really far away and getting away from it all. Do you have any suggestions for me?	Where would you be leaving from and how long is your trip?
I would be leaving from Sydney and I have to be back by Wednesday, September 7.  I'm so excited!	Do you have any destinations in mind?
Not really. As long as it is within those dates, or even returning a bit earlier,  and also within my budget, I really don't care where I go. I am just happy to get out of Sydney for a while.	Great! I'll see what I can do. What is your budget for this trip?
I just got my big yearly bonus so I have $6100.00 to spend. Send me as far away as possible!	Can I interest you in a 5 day 4 star package to Naples, a 9 day 5 star package in Berlin or an 8 day 3 star package in Manaus, Brazil?
What are the dates for the Berlin package? A 5 star package sounds fantastic, as long as it is within my budget.	You would depart on Saturday, August 27th and return on Sunday, September 4th.
What else is included in that package?	Free breakfast and free wifi. It is well within your budget at 4018.16 USD. Would you like me to search packages in the 5000 USD range?
No, but can you please give me some flight details on it? I don't like flying out too early in the morning! Also, would I be flying economy or business class?	Departure from Sydney is at 12:00pm, arrival in Berlin is at 8:37pm. For the return flight, you would depart Berlin at 3:00am and land in Sydney at 11:37am. This is a business class flight.
3:00am flight out of Berlin? No way! That means I will have to be at the airport at like midnight! What are the dates for the 8 day package to Brazil? Are the flights any better on that one? And how much is that package?	The Brazil package is from August 26th to September 1st at a total of 4006.85 USD. Unfortunately, all return flights to Sydney leave at 3:00 am.
Is it a business class flight also? Do I get a free breakfast and wifi with that one?	The flight is business class and breakfast, wifi and parking are all included in your stay at this 3 star hotel. Can I interest you in a 4 star hotel in Brazil for 5003.33USD and a 8.8/10 guest rating?
Hmmmm that one could be interesting too. A 4 star would be much better. I don't trust 3 star hotels, they are full of cockroaches! Are the dates and flights the same on that package?	They are similar. Departure from Sydney is on August 27 at 11:00am and the return flight is on September 3rd at 3:00am. Breakfast, wifi and parking are all included.
Do you have a flight that departs closer to August 22nd by any chance?	The closest I have is the 3 star 8 day package to Manaus we spoke of earlier. The flight is on August 26th.
How much is the the 4 star rated hotel to Brazil? Was that one on a business class flight also?	The 4 star package to Campinas, Brazil is 5003.33 USD, this includes business class flights.

Well, how about Guadalajara then. I heard it's still pretty dangerous there, but it apparently has some nice beaches! We just gotta keep it under $4000!	im sorry to tell you this but there seems to be no packages for there either, we have dominican republic if you are interested?
I heard the food sucks in Dominican Republic, but if it's within our budget and at least 6 days, I guess I'll take some info on Dominican Republic. Is it at least a five star hotel?	Actually there is only a 2.5 star  hotel

That does not work for us, we have to leave on the 19th and I only have a week off work. Have a nice day.	it seems that there are packages to Porto but only later in august are you flexible with your dates?
